I am pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. My research is supervised by Prof. [Zheng Chang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=MmARrhAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). Now I am a visiting PhD student at the School of Computer Science, University College Dublin, supervised by Prof. [Madhusanka Liyanage](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=p1n0ioUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I am a student member of IEEE. I served as the TPC member of IEEE WCNC2024-WS11. My research is primarily centered around the utilization of AI in **UAV wireless networks**. The key objectives are to address <font color=Navy>"how the UVA wireless networks can provide better wireless access service and edge computing service as aerial BSs"</font> with the help of **DL/ML**.
